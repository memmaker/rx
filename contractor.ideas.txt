Clothing & Disguise System

1: Getting jumped by thugs if you’re wearing nice clothes in a bad area
2: Being able to pose as a sex worker to lure a feeding victim to a secluded area if you’re wearing something revealing.

A disguise mechanic similar to Hitman or what FNV tried to do, I wish I could take down a security guard and wear their uniform to sneak into a place, dress like a doctor or nurse to steal some blood or even having a mision where I have the choice to frame a character for a crime I comitted while wearing their clothes
