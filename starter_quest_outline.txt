The starter/example quest that will set the tone for the game

Delivered to your home_terminal is a job offer from a new client:

"Extract $500 from the Ripperdoc in the northside residential area. He owes Jacob."

The offer is signed with a simple "Jacob".

The money has to be deposited in the dead_drop you always use.

If done correctly, the client will retrieve the money and leave a reward for the player.

Now the player should have these options:

- Get the money from the Ripperdoc
  - by force
    - non-lethal
    - lethal
  - by persuasion
  - by stealing from his secret stash
- Negotiate with the Ripperdoc
  - to pay you double
  - to pay you at least half
  - to reward you for going after the client
- Find the old ripperdoc, locked away in the cellar of the hospital
  - to kill him
  - to free him
  - to get information from him about the secret stash
- Pay out of his own pocket, or with money stolen from someone else
- Ignore the job
- Find out more about the client and go after him (from either the doc or grim)
  - to kill him
  - to get more payment
  - to intimidate him into leaving the Doc alone
  - to steal money from him

So how does the world react to the player's actions?

Resolving the situation in any of these ways will be rewarded with XP.
- If the player kills the Ripperdoc, the hospital will be closed for a few days and finally a new Ripperdoc will take over.
- If the player makes the Ripperdoc pay, the Ripperdoc will be angry but compliant.
- If the player goes after the client, the client will
  - be dead and not appear in the game anymore
  - be scared and pay the player more
  - be angry and call goons on the player (only if player is combative, so the client expected to need support)
  - be impressed and offer the player a better job
  - be intimidated and leave the Doc and Player alone
- If the player pays out of his own pocket, the job will be done.

The only way to get no XP is to ignore the job completely.
- If the player ignores the job, the client will hire someone else and the player will not get any reward. The ripperdoc will be attacked in a scripted event.

These options offer a solution at least for the basic three player types:
 - Fighter
 - Diplomat
 - Thief

You can be the good guy, the bad guy, or the guy who doesn't care.

There is one clever and cool way to solve the quest, and that is to steal the money from the client
and give it right back to him.
