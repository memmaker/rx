How to apply GURPS?

We will use the combat mechanics & maneuvers.
-> Acquire maneuvers one by one,
and add them to a contextual (?) quickbar.
Weapon, Armor & Monster Stats

No real encumbrance rules.
Instead, we will apply maluses to dodge and basic speed,
depending on armor worn.
-> Effect: Heavy armor less dodge and running speed.

We use it for all skill rolls.

For ranged weapons, we'll use the accuracy rules.
Crossbows will have fixed damage and STR requirements.
Bows will have damage depend on STR directly.

We'll use save rolls for magic.
