A nymph is a minor female nature deity in ancient Greek folklore, and belief in nymphs survived in many parts of Greece up to as recently as the early 20th century. Usually depicted as beautiful maidens, they were not necessarily immortal, but lived much longer than humans. Nymphs are generally regarded as personifications of nature and typically tied to a specific place or landform.

They are often divided into various broad subgroups, such as the Meliae (ash tree nymphs), the Naiads (freshwater nymphs), the Nereids (sea nymphs), and the Oreads (mountain nymphs) - the three types of nymph in NetHack (wood, water and mountain) may be a rough analogue to this. Nymphs generating asleep may also be based on the common motif of a sleeping nymph in a grotto or spring, which became prominent in European sculpture during the Renaissance; these sculptures were based off a report in the 15th century of a similar Roman statue at a fountain near the Danube, which is now widely considered forged.

In Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, nymphs had no offensive capabilities of their own, but displayed the ability to charm and immobilize onlookers to much more severe degrees than displayed in NetHack - looking at one could cause permanent blindness, and the sight of a disrobing nymph could kill an onlooker outright. Nymphs were able to teleport short distances via a dimension door spell, hence their teleporting abilities in NetHack.


Nymphs are first introduced in Hack for PDP-11,
a variant of Jay Fenlason's Hack.

From Hack 1.0 to NetHack 2.3e, nymphs used the "N" glyph.

The three distinct subtypes of nymph are introduced in NetHack 3.0.0,
and all three were moved to the n glyph.
