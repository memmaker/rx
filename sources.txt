We need different types of modifications to stats:

Flat Modifier, Capped or Min Value, for one roll
Flat / Percentage, while a condition holds

Apply the margin of one roll to the next roll of a certain type,
in the next (n) turn(s) only

Ways to modify a stat:
 - func EVA(in) -> out
   - Percentage modifier
   - Flat modifier
   - Clamp to min/max value

Timeframes for modifications:
 - While a condition is met
   - Hasn't been applied for N turns/rolls
   - Status effect is active
   - Stat is above/below a certain value
   - When next to a wall
 - Two modes
   - Apply once and remove automatically
   - Apply as long as possible, until manually removed

modifier = {
  type: 'flat',
  value: 5,
  apply: 'once',
}

Char.AddMod(modifier, shouldApply)
 - all stat modifiers are applied directly to the stat itself
 - no modification outside of the char

Rules.RollRangedAttack(shooter, target, weapon)
 - all modifiers are applied in by the method in the rules.
 - no rolls outside the rules

ONLY two Places in the code that need to apply modifiers:
 - To stats directly
   - When doing a success roll bases on a stat the roll modifiers need to be applied
   - When looking up a stat during a roll or for the char sheet, the modifiers need to be applied
 - According to the circumstances of a specific roll
   - Modifiers based on the size or distance to a target are of a different nature, they are not modifying a specific stat but a task

SO NO Modifiers except
 - Stat mods explicitly added to a char
 - Modifiers that are encapsulated in a rules roll method
