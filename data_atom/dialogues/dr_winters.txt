+ The breakdown is simple. You are running out of blood.
+ You could undergo a series of transfusions, but that's just a temporary fix.
+ There is a permanent solution, but it's not for everyone, and it's not cheap.
+ Depending on your 'insurance', I might also be able to offer you some more experimental treatments.

npc:
+ Well, BioPharma has developed a new treatment, called the "Replacement Therapy".
+ It's very promising, but it does have two drawbacks.
+ First, it's expensive. Second, it's not yet approved by the FDA.
+ However, I do know a guy who can get you in. I could pull some strings.
+ For a price, of course. Let's say, 10,000 caps.

npc:
