[#FFFFFF]This human-sized violet plant shaped as a teardrop has four tendril like tentacles which flail about at living creatures and a mass of small, rootlike feelers at its base that enable it to move slowly.[-]

[#f5e342]Rogue Trivia[-]

Another monster taken directly from the DnD Monster Manuel 1st Edition.

It was already present in the very first public release of rogue we can find, version 3.6.

For the 5.4 and the DOS Version, this monster was renamed to Venus Flytrap.

While Rogue 5.4 has replaced the name in both the monster list and the comments in the fight.c file,
the DOS version still calls the attacking monster a violet fungi in one of the comments:

/* extern.c of Rogue-1.48 EPYX */
{ "venus flytrap", 0, ISMEAN, { XX,   80,  8,  3, ___, "%%%d0"} },

/* fight.c of Rogue-1.48 EPYX */
case 'F': //Violet fungi stops the poor guy from moving
  player.t_flags |= ISHELD;
  sprintf(mp->t_stats.s_dmg, "%dd1", ++fung_hit);
break;

This might be an indicator, that the DOS version was based on an earlier version of Rogue, which still used the original name.
