[#FFFFFF]This normally aquatic creature has adapted to the environment of the Dungeons of Doom by continuously spraying it's surroundings with a liquid it secretes from the top of it's head. Seems relatively harmless.[-]

[#f5e342]Rogue Trivia[-]

The original name of this monster is rust monster.

It was then changed to dodge copyright issues.

The original code for rusting armor was pretty simple:

/* Rogue 3.6 - 1981 */

/*
 * If a rust monster hits, you lose armor
 */
if (cur_armor != NULL && cur_armor->o_ac < 9)
{
	if (!terse)
		msg("Your armor appears to be weaker now. Oh my!");
	else
		msg("Your armor weakens");
	cur_armor->o_ac++;
}

Of course leather armor should have been immune to rusting, but it wasn't.

That was soon fixed in the later versions:

/* Rogue 5.2.1 - 1982 */
/*
 * If a rust monster hits, you lose armor, unless
 * that armor is leather or there is a magic ring
 */
if (cur_armor != NULL && cur_armor->o_ac < 9 && cur_armor->o_which != LEATHER)
{
	if (ISWEARING(R_SUSTARM))
		msg("The rust vanishes instantly");
	else
	{
		cur_armor->o_ac++;
		if (!terse)
			msg("your armor appears to be weaker now. Oh my!");
		else
			msg("your armor weakens");
	}
}

This version also gave the player a chance to save their armor by wearing a ring of sustain armor.

For the 5.4 release, the code for rusting the armor was extracted into it's own function:

/*
 * rust_armor:
 *	Rust the given armor, if it is a legal kind to rust, and we
 *	aren't wearing a magic ring.
 */

void
rust_armor(THING *arm)
{
    if (arm == NULL || arm->o_type != ARMOR || arm->o_which == LEATHER || arm->o_arm >= 9)
	    return;

    if ((arm->o_flags & ISPROT) || ISWEARING(R_SUSTARM))
    {
		if (!to_death)
	    	msg("the rust vanishes instantly");
    }
    else
    {
	arm->o_arm++;
	if (!terse)
	    msg("your armor appears to be weaker now. Oh my!");
	else
	    msg("your armor weakens");
    }
}

Especially interesting is the fact, that an armor can now be flagged as protected from rust.
To this end rogue 5.4 provides a scroll of protection, which can be read to protect the armor from rusting.

The DOS Release 1.48 the simplified things back to where they were in 5.2.1:

case 'A': //If a rust monster hits, you lose armor, unless that armor is leather or there is a magic ring
	if (cur_armor != NULL && cur_armor->o_ac < 9 && cur_armor->o_which != LEATHER)
	{
		if (ISWEARING(R_SUSTARM))
			msg("the rust vanishes instantly");
		else
		{
			msg("your armor weakens, oh my!");
			cur_armor->o_ac++;
		}
	}
	break;
