Thoughts on Fallout

   - Quests for finding blueprints, text books, etc.
 - Make the map fully explorable & procedurally generated
   - Ruins
   - Caves
   - Freeways
   - Roads
   - Towns
   - Vaults
 - Creatures should respawn nearly everywhere
   - Make it organically, certain groups come in and take over
 - Have NPCs react to armor, weapons, companions, past actions, etc.
   - Unique reactions for NPCs (clothing vendor and not wearing pants)
 - The map itself should change over time, depending on your actions
 - Endslides should include all long-term consequences
 - Charisma should be more important
